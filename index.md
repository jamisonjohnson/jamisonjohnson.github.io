## Welcome to My IT Portfolio!


With over 13 years of experience in government support and system administration, I bring a wealth of expertise in various areas of IT. As a seasoned professional, I have a strong command of DoD security standards, network security protocols, system hardening, and troubleshooting both software and hardware. My proficiency extends to administering Linux distributions such as RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu, as well as managing Windows 10/11 and Windows Server environments. Additionally, I excel in creating and maintaining VMware vSphere virtual environments. 

In addition to my professional endeavors, I also offer my services as a freelance web developer, creating static websites that cater to the specific needs of clients. I take great pride in crafting well-designed and functional websites that align with the vision and goals of businesses and individuals. Whether it's establishing an online presence for a small business or showcasing a personal portfolio, I strive to deliver professional and high-quality results.

With an unwavering work ethic and a passion for tackling challenging projects, I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and skills while applying them to support the mission at hand. 

Join me on this journey as I showcase my accomplishments, skills, and dedication to IT excellence.
